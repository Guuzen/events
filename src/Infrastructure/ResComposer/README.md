## Example 1. User has UserInfo
There is a User with id '1' and related UserInfo that contains this id, and some information about User (fullname, contacts etc).
```php
$user = ['id' => '1'];
$userInfo = [
    'userId' => '1',
    'fullname' => 'John Doe'
];    
```
The goal is to join User with his UserInfo.
```php
```
